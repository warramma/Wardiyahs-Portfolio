            <p>Welcome to my project gallery! Most of these projects were coded with HTML and CSS, with some vanilla Javascript, and a sprinkle of C#. I currently do mostly responsive web design projects and am working in developing proficiency in JavaScript. I also have a budding interest in C# and Unity and am planning to explore cybersecurity. </p>

            <h1>My CS Journey</h1>
            <p>Although I've always nursed an interest in computer science and tech, I never thought of applying that interest to my future. Consequently, I was left dealing with an existential crisis for much of middle school and a good portion of high school. Early on, people around me had begun pressuring me to choose my future career. Although they meant well, I felt suffocated by the fact that no career suggested ever felt right. As a person used to academic excellence, this made me feel like a failure. “What do you like to do?” my counselor would ask, exasperated. “I don’t know,” I’d respond miserably. “I’m sorry.” It looked like my only option was to become a doctor, an idea that made my stomach sink.
            </p>
            <p>The problem was, I knew what I liked, even loved: technology. Ever since kindergarten, I adored everything technology related, including coding. However, repeatedly being told that computer science was lame and for guys discouraged me. Because of this, I never let myself entertain the idea of pursuing a career in the field, despite Computer Science being my favorite class. 
            </p>
            <p>After a hard year dealing with remote school, dipping mental health, personal injuries, and the virus-that-shall-not-be-named, I decided I was done letting people decide my future. With my newfound drive, I sought out free coding resources online and taught myself HTML and CSS. Learning more about CS even pushed me out of my comfort zone: I took a leap of faith and applied for a Kode With Klossy scholarship. After getting in, I was able to learn and improve alongside other amazing girls and inspire myself to code for social good. At the end, I was even more determined to seize whatever opportunities came my way. I put myself out there and made new connections. I participated in my first hackathon. I even spent over 100 hours earning my Responsive Web Design certification from freeCodeCamp. The most important thing, though: the future no longer felt like a looming threat.
            </p>
            <p>In my journey to improve myself and pursue my passions in tech, I aim to help make the tech space more inclusive. As someone also interested in cybersecurity, I also want to do my part in helping to make cybersecurity safer and more accessible around the world. </p>
