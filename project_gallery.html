                            Another Kode With Klossy project, Bumble Bee Facts is a fun little puzzle game I made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. It was difficult figuring out how to revert the page back to its original state, but with some help from other scholars, I was able to bring my idea to reality.

                            This technical documentation project was part of my certification in Responsive Web Design from freeCodeCamp. What I’m most proud of is the minimalist aesthetic and how the navigation menu adapts to fit different screen sizes. In this project, I practiced HTML hyperlinks and media queries.

                            Shatter Glass was the last project I worked on for Kode With Klossy. It was also the first coding project I ever did with a team. It was a little hard due to internet difficulties and Zoom glitches, but in the end, I’m really proud of the work we got done together. Fueled by our passion for equality in the workplace, we created a website touching on major issues and compiling important resources. I learned a lot from my teammates and I realized how valuable different perspectives are, especially in projects aimed towards social good.

                            Behold, my first ever portfolio. Here lies my old portfolio, which I created to earn my freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. It uses a one page layout, with the nav bar leading to different parts of the page. I struggled to make the text boxes uniform and didn’t bother changing the scrolling effect, which I think was a missed opportunity. However, I am proud of how responsive the page is, specifically how it changes from two columns to one to better suit the screen.

                            For a while, it had bothered me how outdated the high school portion of the school website was. And for a long while, I didn’t think I could do anything about it. Until, with the prompting of a good friend, I decided to offer my skills to my school admin (who gladly agreed). At this point, I’d only been tinkering around with HTML, CSS, and JS for roughly a month. I expected to help code a simple site from scratch<span id="dots">...</span> <span id="more">that would include everything needed: supply list, resources, graduation requirements, etc.  It turned out to be a lot more than I bargained for. From Azure DevOps to Visual Studio 2019 to using C# and MVC models, I was quickly in over my head. It took asking for help, endless internet searches, and plenty of experimentation to finally deploy the HS school supply list (linked below) for all to see. In addition to the supply list, I also made some basic updates to the home page. This included adding an image and a link to the Google Site home.

                            My project titled bismillah is a website I created advocating for better Muslim representation. Submitted for the 2022 Congressional App Challenge, I won first prize for my congressional district. The project is named after the word “bismillah”, Arabic for “in the name of God” and a ubiquitous Muslim expression. In making this site, I practiced breaking down big tasks into smaller, more manageable ones. I also improved my own coding skills and tried new techniques such as animated flip cards, CSS Grid, searching within a page, text animation, and more. Overall, working on this project was a fun and enlightening journey.
