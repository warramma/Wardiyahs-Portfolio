            <p>Welcome to my project gallery! Most of these projects were coded with HTML and CSS, with some vanilla Javascript, and a sprinkle of C#. I currently do mostly responsive web design projects and am working in developing proficiency in JavaScript. I also have a budding interest in C# and Unity and am planning to explore cybersecurity. </p>

            <h1 id="projectJourney">My CS Journey</h1>
            <p>
                Although I've always nursed an interest in computer science and tech, I never thought of applying that interest to my future. Consequently, I was left dealing with an existential crisis for much of middle school and a good portion of high school. Early on, people around me had begun pressuring me to choose my future career. Although they meant well, I felt suffocated by the fact that no career suggested ever felt right. As a person used to academic excellence, this made me feel like a failure. “What do you like to do?” my counselor would ask, exasperated. “I don’t know,” I’d respond miserably. “I’m sorry.” It looked like my only option was to become a doctor, an idea that made my stomach sink.
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem was, I knew what I liked, even loved: technology. Ever since kindergarten, I adored everything technology related, including coding. However, repeatedly being told that computer science was lame and for guys discouraged me. Because of this, I never let myself entertain the idea of pursuing a career in the field, despite Computer Science being my favorite class. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After a hard year dealing with remote school, dipping mental health, personal injuries, and the virus-that-shall-not-be-named, I decided I was done letting people decide my future. With my newfound drive, I sought out free coding resources online and taught myself HTML and CSS. Learning more about CS even pushed me out of my comfort zone: I took a leap of faith and applied for a Kode With Klossy scholarship. After getting in, I was able to learn and improve alongside other amazing girls and inspire myself to code for social good. At the end, I was even more determined to seize whatever opportunities came my way. I put myself out there and made new connections. I participated in my first hackathon. I even spent over 100 hours earning my Responsive Web Design certification from freeCodeCamp. The most important thing, though: the future no longer felt like a looming threat.
            </p>
            <p>In my journey to improve myself and pursue my passions in tech, I aim to help make the tech space more inclusive. As someone also interested in cybersecurity, I also want to do my part in helping to make cybersecurity safer and more accessible around the world. </p>

                        <p>This was the first HTML/CSS project I’d done in a while since Intro to Computer Science roughly two years ago. It was also the project that started off my first ( and hopefully not last) Kode With Klossy experience. With this project, I reviewed basic HTML and CSS and improved my skills with CSS Flexbox. The project is inspired by my love of the color blue. </p>

                            Another Kode With Klossy project, Bumble Bee Facts is a fun little puzzle game I made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. It was difficult figuring out how to revert the page back to its original state, but with some help from other scholars, I was able to bring my idea to reality.

                            This technical documentation project was part of my certification in Responsive Web Design from freeCodeCamp. What I’m most proud of is the minimalist aesthetic and how the navigation menu adapts to fit different screen sizes. In this project, I practiced HTML hyperlinks and media queries.

                            Shatter Glass was the last project I worked on for Kode With Klossy. It was also the first coding project I ever did with a team. It was a little hard due to internet difficulties and Zoom glitches, but in the end, I’m really proud of the work we got done together. Fueled by our passion for equality in the workplace, we created a website touching on major issues and compiling important resources. I learned a lot from my teammates and I realized how valuable different perspectives are, especially in projects aimed towards social good.

                            Behold, my first ever portfolio. Here lies my old portfolio, which I created to earn my freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. It uses a one page layout, with the nav bar leading to different parts of the page. I struggled to make the text boxes uniform and didn’t bother changing the scrolling effect, which I think was a missed opportunity. However, I am proud of how responsive the page is, specifically how it changes from two columns to one to better suit the screen.

                            For a while, it had bothered me how outdated the high school portion of the school website was. And for a long while, I didn’t think I could do anything about it. Until, with the prompting of a good friend, I decided to offer my skills to my school admin (who gladly agreed). At this point, I’d only been tinkering around with HTML, CSS, and JS for roughly a month. I expected to help code a simple site from scratch that would include everything needed: supply list, resources, graduation requirements, etc.  It turned out to be a lot more than I bargained for. From Azure DevOps to Visual Studio 2019 to using C# and MVC models, I was quickly in over my head. It took asking for help, endless internet searches, and plenty of experimentation to finally deploy the HS school supply list (linked below) for all to see. In addition to the supply list, I also made some basic updates to the home page. This included adding an image and a link to the Google Site home.

                            When I first heard about the Congressional App challenge a year ago, I thought I wasn’t good enough. Now after a year of self-reflection and months of learning about responsive web design, I’m eager to take part in this nationwide challenge. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My project titled bismillah is a website I created advocating for better Muslim representation. The project is named after the word “bismillah”, Arabic for “in the name of God” and a ubiquitous Muslim expression. In making this site, I practiced breaking down big tasks into smaller, more manageable ones. I also improved my own coding skills and tried new techniques such as animated flip cards, CSS Grid, searching within a page, text animation, and more. Overall, working on this project was a fun and enlightening journey. Even if it doesn’t win, I’m glad I spent so much time working on it.
